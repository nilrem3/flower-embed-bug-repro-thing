            <p>This 6 checkpoint map is quite long and difficult, having around 80 rooms and peaking at high red gm difficulty.  However, if you're up for the challenge it's absolutely worth it.  The gameplay is phenomenal, making extremely creative use of the limited entity pallette.  Most of the entities in the map are just various kinds of blocks, such as switch gates, falling blocks, intro crushers and crumble on touch blocks.  The music for this map was composed by the wonderful Matt Sexton and is probably the best soundtrack created for any Celeste mod ever.</p>

          <p>Found in the medium lobby of the Secret Santa Collab 2024, this map stands out like a gemstone from the already incredible maps that make up the rest of the collab.  Fonda makes use of many kinds of swap blocks throughout the map to make gameplay that looks and feels incredible while also being extremely intuitive.  The lack of complicated tech and intuitive gameplay design makes many of the rooms sightreadable.  By the end of the first checkpoint I was already amazed at the variety of flashy moves that Fonda had crafted.  It felt like each room had its own distinct identity while at the same time being closely tied together with the rest of the map.  Somehow, Fonda manages to keep this feeling that each room is unique through the entire length of the map, which is not by any means short.  As if that wasn't enough, this map also comes with a riveting story.  Normally, I'm not one to pay too much attention to the story of Celeste maps.  I always read the story, but it's secondary to the gameplay for me.  Despite that, Journeys had me hooked almost from the start.  Top things off with an excellently selected soundtrack and you have my favourite map I've ever played.</p>

            <p>Originally created for the Celeste Sightreading Compettition, Counterclockwise is a tech-focused expert map with impressive visuals.  The movement, while pretty standard techspam, is very well polished, with lenient hazards and no jank to speak of.  The imposing machinery in the stylegrounds integrates cohesively with the visual style of the foreground elements to truly give the impression of being dwarfed inside an enormous clock.  A very solid example of how to make a map well. </p>
