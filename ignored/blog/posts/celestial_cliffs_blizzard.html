  This map has beautiful deco, as is to be expected from the CN mapping team at this point. They've made their expertise in deco very clear.  The gameplay is a faithful recreation of the style used in 4a, with a couple small additions. In particular, the use of wind in this map is very creative. It's nice to see an often-hated mechanic like wind used in such a polished way. Towards the end, these fields that cause some breakable blocks to break were introduced but I feel like they were not really explored very much.  There were only a couple rooms that used them and they didn't really feel like anything unique.  I would like to see more gameplay using them in the future though, I feel like there is some potential.
