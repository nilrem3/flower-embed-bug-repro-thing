            <p>This 6 checkpoint map is quite long and difficult, having around 80 rooms and peaking at red gm difficulty. However, if you're up to the challenge, it's absolutely worth it. The gameplay is phenomenal, making extremely creative use of the limited entity pallette. Most of the entities in the map are various kinds of blocks, such as switch gates, falling blocks, intro crushers and crumble on touch blocks. The music for this map was composed by the wonderful Matt Sexton and is probably the best soundtrack created for any Celeste mod ever.</p>
